<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a currently a third year (2022.09-) Master student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by <a href='http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/liqiang15/zh_CN/index.htm'>Qiang Li</a> and <a href='https://andysis.github.io/'>Zhiwei Wang</a>. Before that, I recieved my Bachelor Engineering degree at the HUST in 2022.

My research interests foucs on algorithms for Health Examination in Endoscopy images/videos, including segmentation, detection, classfication. Recently, I am exploring the  potential of visual-language models for endoscopy. If you are interested in my research, welcome to communicate with me!!!

[MonoBox: Tightness-free Box-supervised Polyp Segmentation using Monotonicity Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01188)

**Qiang Hu**, Zhenyu Yi, Ying Zhou, Fan Huang, Mei Liu, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang&#8224;

[**Code**](https://github.com/Huster-Hq/MonoBox)
[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01188)
- MonoBox proposes a novel monotonicity constraint to liberate the training of existing MIL-based box-supervised segmentation methods from the user-unfriendly box-tightness assumption. It is plug-and-play and can improve the tolerance of any MIL-based box-supervised segmentation methods (e.g., BoxInst, BoxLevelSet, IBoxCLA, etc.) to tightness-free box annotations in any scenarios (e.g., common, medical, etc.).

[Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy]()

**Qiang Hu**&#42;, Qimei Wang&#42;, Jia Chen, Xuantao Ji, Mei Liu, Qiang Li&#8224;, and Zhiwei Wang&#8224;

[**Code**](https://github.com/Huster-Hq/ADD)
[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19319)
- We propose a novel holistic WLI polyp classification framework, which mainly prpose a novel module, Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD), to leverage NBI knowledge to assist holistic WLI polyp classifier without requiring geometric priors (e.g., polyp locations).

[First-frame Supervised Video Polyp Segmentation via Propagative and Semantic Dual-teacher Network]()

**Qiang Hu**, Mei Liu, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang&#8224;

[**Code**](https://github.com/Huster-Hq/PSDNet)
[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16503)
- PSDNet greatly reduces the labeling costs of training video segmentation models, which require only one frame of annotation on each video, regardless of the length. It benefits from the existing powerful fundamental video segmentation models (e.g., XMem and SAM 2).

[SALI: Short-Term Alignment and Long-Term Interaction Network for Colonoscopy Video Polyp Segmentation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72089-5_50)

**Qiang Hu**&#42;, Zhenyu Yi&#42;, Ying Zhou, Fang Peng, Mei Liu, Qiang Li&#8224;, Zhiwei Wang&#8224;

[**Code**](https://github.com/Scatteredrain/SALI)
[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13532)
- SALI, a hybrid of Short-term Alignment Module (SAM) and Long-term Interaction Module (LIM), achieves the SOTA performance on the SUN-SEG dataset (currently the largest video polyp segmentation dataset).

[Targeted False Positive Synthesis via Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker for Robust Polyp Detection]()

Quan Zhou&#42;, Gan Luo&#42;, **Qiang Hu**&#8224;, Qingyong Zhang, Yinjiao Tian, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang&#8224;

[**Code**](https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA)
[**Paper**]()
- To reduce false positive predictions of polyp detectors in clinical applications, we propose a novel image synthesis method, namely DADA, that integrates diffusion models with adversarial attacks, focusing on generating high-value negative samples capable of effectively misleading polyp detectors.
